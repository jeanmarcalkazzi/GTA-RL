# Learning Heuristics for Dynamic Graph Combinatorial Optimization

Spatio-Temporal architecture to solve dynamic combinatorial optimization and this code base build on top of the following code (https://github.com/wouterkool/attention-learn-to-route). 

Currently, dynamic versions of Travelling Salesmen Problem and Vehicle Routing Problem are supported. 

## Requirements

* Python>=3.8
* NumPy
* SciPy
* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)>=1.7
* tqdm
* [tensorboard_logger](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/tensorboard_logger)
* Matplotlib (optional, only for plotting)



## Acknowledgements
We thank attention learning to route [https://github.com/wouterkool/attention-learn-to-route] for easily extendable code base.
